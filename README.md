# Instagram-google-account-generation-bot
A script that generates a list of people, saves data to a .txt file and then creates Gmail and Instagram account for those people.

NOTE: This does not work as Google and Instagram have updated their sign up pages.

NOTE: This will probably not run as is on your computer since the bot that I use goes to certain x,y coordinates to click on things. Those x,y coords are specific to my computer. I should of used height and width ratios as x.y coords not the actual values.
